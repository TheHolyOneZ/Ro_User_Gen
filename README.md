 - Validater (Valides the raw users generated by "usernaame gen"


Guide:

1. Run txt_gen.py first.
2. Select your items.
3. After that, it should generate a .txt file with raw, unvalidated usernames.
4. Once the process is finished (it should take around 0.1â€“1 second), run validate.py.
5. Enter the path to the .txt file you just generated or simply provide the filename.
6. Let validate.py process the file. If you want to stop the validation early, you can click the "Stop Validating" button.
     Note: Stopping early will save the valid usernames found up to that point, but the process will stop instantly.
